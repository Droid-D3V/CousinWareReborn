# CousinWare

CousinWare is the client I've been working on for about 9 months. It was originally a client made for my friends but seeing as how I'm leaving the community (and already have), thought I'd make it public.

## FAQ

Is this Project going to be good? - Yes! It will have a custom Baritone and some new exploits

Is CousinWare Reborn going to have exclusive bypasses? - Yep, it will have a 1.8.9 Hypixel client too, but it will be paid
